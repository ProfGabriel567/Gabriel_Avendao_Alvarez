Cliente feliz iconos creados por Freepik - Flaticon</a>About me:
I have a degree in Computer Science and am passionate about programming, databases, and web development. I have been teaching students in the Computer Systems program for a decade. Recently, I completed a QA Engineer specialization at a TripleTen bootcamp where I completed nine projects ranging from test case design, mind map design, website testing, mobile app testing, API testing using Postman, and bug reporting with Jira. I also have experience developing programs with Visual C#.Net, Visual Basic.Net, PHP, SQL Server, and using tools such as Dreamweaver, Illustrator, and Animate. I am currently interested in joining a technology project where I can contribute and develop my knowledge and experience.
